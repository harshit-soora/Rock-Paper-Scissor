**Build**
> g++ Game.cpp -o Game


**Launch**
Either launch "Game" from terminal
> Game
or
Double click the "Game" application to launch [Windows]


**Test**
Launch Game with argument "test" from terminal to run in test mode
> Game test

Logs will be redirected to "test_output.txt" file.

Since this will not be a user interaction, 
thus adding logs to terminal will not be thoughtful

## Design Structure
- There are two classes: Game and Tester
- Game class implements the core functionality of the Rock-Paper-Scissor Game
- Tester class it to test the Game class on all possible user inputs, 
    and check if correct output is being displayed

- Object oriented programming apporach is used
- Each class is created with a constructor and destructor
- All class members are prefixed with "m_" for easy identification
- Any in-method varible is being declared at start of a method to keep track
- Objects are being destored and pointers are set to null upon destruction


## Functioning
- Rock, Paper, Scissor are equivalent to 0, 1, 2
- By theory,
- Rock is strong over Scissor
- Paper is strong over Rock
- Scissor is strong over Paper
- this simplifies to "(i+1)th mod" <integer to option> is stronger over "ith" option


## Testing and Use
- Application is being developed and tested on windows machine
- Linux and Mac OS should be straight forward, just need to be build there.

Linux
For test mode
> ./Game test 
For user mode
> ./Game
